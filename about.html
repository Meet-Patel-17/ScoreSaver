                <p>
                    Welcome to my SAT&ACT study hub. I am a high school student who goes to 
                    Fern Creek High School in Kentucky, Louisville. I am 17 years old. I have created this platform 
                    to provide students with the resources and guidance they need to succeed in their SAT and ACT exams. 
                    I hope you enjoy my wesbite and get help that you need with ACT or SAT study. Please let me know 
                    your feedback in the feedback form of what i can add or improve so student can have better experience.
